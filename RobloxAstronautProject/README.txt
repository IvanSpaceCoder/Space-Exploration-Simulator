This project is an **interactive planet HUD** in Roblox, featuring realistic information about planets, and a functional spaceship

--PLANET HUD--
When approaching a planet and pressing 'E' a window displays:
Planet name
Gravity (m/s²)
Planet type ( rocky,gaseous, etc..)
Planet temperature
Sound effect when opening and closing info

--SPACESHIP INTERACTION-- 

When you sit down, the spaceship starts with an alarm displaying for 5 seconds with smoke particles in it and then, it starts flying with fire particles with a rocket loop and gradually increases speed in steps of 10,
also. It prepare it's boosters to fall down and start to accelerate a lot

--APPLIED PHYSICS--
Newton's First law: the spaceship continues moving unless an external force acts on it
Newton's Second law: the boosters of the spaceship are moving the main basepart of the spaceship, the capsule.
Space Friction: this is practically ignored due to being extremely minimal.

## How to use
1.Open the project in Roblox Studio.
2. Play the game.
3. Approach a planet and press 'E' to open the HUD
4. Sit on the spaceship and observe how it reacts
