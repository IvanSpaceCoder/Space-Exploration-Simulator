# Space Exploration Simulator

Interactive space simulator in Roblox with realistic orbital physics.

## 🚀 Features

### Planet Information System
- Press 'E' near planets to view data
- Displays: Name, Gravity, Type, Temperature, **Escape Velocity**
- **Escape velocity calculated using real physics**: √(2 × G × Mass / Radius)
- Interactive sound effects

### Realistic Spaceship
- **Gradual acceleration** (realistic physics, not instant jumps)
- **Fuel consumption system** with real-time display
- Booster separation like real rockets
- Particle effects (smoke + fire)
- Sound design

## 📐 Physics Implemented

- **Escape Velocity Formula**: √(2 × G × Mass / Radius)
- Newton's First Law: Inertia in space
- Newton's Second Law: F = ma
- Minimal space friction (realistic)
- Example: Mars escape velocity = ~5,016 m/s (calculated from real mass/radius)
